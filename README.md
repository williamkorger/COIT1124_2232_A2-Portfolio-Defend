The purpose of the assignment is to improve the cybersecurity of a workstation used by an employee at the Monto Caravan and Cabin Park. The employee's boss has tasked them with implementing and testing a safeguard against potential cyber threats. Specifically, the assignment involves enhancing the security of the employee's Windows 11 virtual machine by:

1. **Implementing DNS Filtering Services:** The employee is required to implement a safeguard (CIS 9.2) that involves using DNS filtering to block access to malicious websites. This is a crucial step to prevent the workstation from accessing websites associated with cyber threats.

2. **Enabling Windows 11 Firewall:** The employee is also tasked with configuring the Windows 11 firewall to block outbound HTTP traffic (port 80). This is aimed at preventing potential malicious communication over HTTP that could be used to compromise the workstation's security.

3. **Testing and Documentation:** Throughout the process, the employee is required to thoroughly test the implemented safeguards to ensure their effectiveness. Screenshots of testing and other relevant steps, along with documentation, are essential to showcase the success of the safeguards and provide evidence of their implementation.

4. **Presentation:** The assignment requires the employee to compile their efforts and evidence into a PowerPoint slideshow. This presentation will serve as a visual and explanatory guide to demonstrate the implemented safeguards and their impact on the workstation's cybersecurity.

In essence, the assignment simulates a real-world scenario where a system administrator or cybersecurity professional is tasked with implementing security measures to protect a virtual machine from potential threats. The assignment tests the employee's ability to understand security concepts, execute technical tasks, document their work, and present their findings in a clear and organized manner. It also familiarizes them with concepts such as DNS filtering, firewall configuration, scripting, and evidence-based reporting.
